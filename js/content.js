    aboutTitle: "From Lexington, Massachusetts to UMass Amherst.",
    aboutCopy: "I grew up in Lexington, Massachusetts and am currently finishing my mechanical engineering degree at UMass Amherst. I like engineering most when I can actually build something, whether that means CAD, machining, prototyping, testing, or fixing something that did not work the first time. Outside of engineering, I enjoy strength training, running, hiking year-round, and traveling. I have visited Hungary, Vietnam, Switzerland, Bosnia, Cambodia, and Chile."

          title: "Problem",
          body: "The chamber initially supported eight independent battery test channels with electrical leads hanging freely from the ceiling. With sixteen additional channels planned, the existing layout would increase cable congestion, make channel identification harder, and slow setup and troubleshooting."
        },
        {
          title: "Design response",
          body: "Jarret designed a custom organizer in SolidWorks with 24 isolated compartments. Velcro-lined positions secure cells while keeping them removable, and integrated hooks allow the assembly to attach to existing lab equipment without a major chamber modification."
        },
        {
          title: "Manufacturing",
          body: "The component was designed as a low-cost, rapidly manufacturable solution and fabricated in PLA using FDM 3D printing. The geometry was developed around the existing chamber and test hardware rather than forcing a new lab layout."
        },
        {
          title: "Result",
          body: "The finished organizer reduces cable congestion, improves channel traceability, and makes connecting and disconnecting coin-cell batteries more efficient during test operations."

          title: "Need",
          body: "The team selected a Noram Cheetah centrifugal clutch for its efficiency, reliability, and usability. A custom interface was required to connect the clutch to the existing drivetrain while also supporting and accurately locating the engine timing gear."
        },
        {
          title: "Requirements",
          body: "The adapter had to transmit drivetrain torque, maintain concentric alignment, preserve timing accuracy, and remain structurally sound under operating loads while fitting around existing OEM and team-designed hardware."
        },
        {
          title: "Design",
          body: "Jarret reverse engineered relevant drivetrain geometry, created the shaft adapter in SolidWorks, and documented the part with an engineering drawing. The adapter provides axial positioning for the timing gear and interfaces with a modified manufacturer-supplied component using four fasteners."

        {
          title: "Integration",
          body: "The completed design was assembled on the engine, providing a practical interface between the centrifugal clutch, engine output shaft, and timing system as part of the club's broader drivetrain-efficiency work."
